Dataco Global Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery Policy
Purpose
This policy establishes procedures, responsibilities, and standards to ensure Dataco Global can
withstand and recover from significant business disruptions, disasters, or security incidents. The
objective is to maintain essential functions and minimize operational, financial, and reputational
impacts.
Scope
This policy applies to all Dataco Global employees, contractors, and stakeholders, and covers all
business units, IT systems, facilities, and third-party dependencies.
Definitions
Business Continuity (BC): The capability to continue essential functions during and after a
disruption.
Disaster Recovery (DR): The process to restore IT systems, data, and infrastructure within
defined timeframes following a disruption.
Policy Statements
1. Risk Assessment and Business Impact Analysis (BIA)
Dataco Global will conduct a formal risk assessment and BIA annually (every 12 months) to
identify critical business functions, potential threats, and quantify impacts. The risk
assessment and BIA report must be completed and submitted by Q1 of each calendar year[5].
All assets supporting mission-critical functions must be classified and documented within the
risk register, updated semi-annually.
2. Recovery Objectives
Recovery Time Objective (RTO): All mission-critical systems must be restored within 4 hours of
a declared disaster.
Recovery Point Objective (RPO): Data loss for mission-critical applications must not exceed 30
minutes.
3. Data Backup and Storage
Full data backups of all production systems must occur daily, with incremental backups every
2 hours.
At least one set of encrypted backup data must be stored offsite at a geographically distinct
location.
Backup restoration tests must be performed quarterly, with a pass rate of 100% for mission-
critical data.

The alternate site must provide capacity for at least 80% of critical staff roles.

documented.
Full-scale BC/DR plan exercises must occur at least twice per year, with incident response
team participation rate at 100%.
Any identified gaps during exercises must result in actionable remediation within 30 days.
7. Plan Review and Maintenance
The Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery Plan (BCDRP) must be reviewed and updated
at minimum every 12 months, or within 7 days following a significant organizational or
technological change.
All revisions to the policy must be approved by the Board of Directors.
8. Third-Party Dependencies
All critical third-party vendors must provide evidence of their own BCDR capabilities and test
results annually.
Contracts with third parties must stipulate a maximum allowable downtime of 4 hours for
services impacting mission-critical functions.
9. Regulatory and Compliance
