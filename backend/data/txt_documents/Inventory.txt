Dataco Global Inventory Management Policy
Purpose
The purpose of this Inventory Management Policy is to establish clear guidelines and standardized
procedures for the effective control, monitoring, and optimization of inventory at Dataco. This
policy aims to ensure accurate tracking, secure storage, timely replenishment, and responsible
disposal of inventory, including specific measures for managing slow-moving and non-moving
items.
Scope
This policy applies to all Dataco employees, contractors, and personnel engaged with inventory
management, including raw materials, finished goods, supplies, and equipment[1].
1. Roles and Responsibilities
Inventory control is a shared responsibility among all employees handling inventory.
Department managers must assign clear roles for inventory oversight and designate staff for
periodic inventory tasks[1].
2. Accurate Recording and Inventory System
All receipts, issues, transfers, and adjustments must be immediately and accurately recorded
in Dataco ºs inventory management system.
Regular (at least quarterly) physical counts must be conducted to reconcile system records
with actual stock[1].
3. Inventory Storage and Security
Inventory must be stored in designated, organized areas that comply with safety and security
standards.
Access to inventory storage is restricted to authorized personnel only. All storage areas must
be secured, and access logs maintained[1][3].
4. Inventory Rotation and Usage
The First-In-First-Out (FIFO) method is mandatory for perishable or date-sensitive items to
minimize waste and preserve quality.
Only authorized employees may access inventory, and all withdrawals must serve approved
business purposes[1][5].
5. Inventory Replenishment and Procurement

Minimum and maximum levels must be set for all critical items.
Automatic alerts or reviews should occur when inventory approaches reorder points to prevent
stockouts or overstocking[1].
6. Slow Mover and No Mover Inventory Policy
Definition:
Slow Mover: Items not issued or used within the last 6 months.
No Mover: Items not issued or used within the last 12 months.
Review Process:
A quarterly review of slow and no mover inventory must be conducted.
Items classified as slow or no movers must be flagged for management review.
Disposition:
Consider deep discount sales, liquidation, return to suppliers, donation, recycling, or
disposal for no mover inventory to free up space and reduce holding costs[5].
Justification is required for continued retention of slow/no mover stock beyond the review
period[5].
Reporting:
A summary report of all slow and no mover inventory actions must be provided to senior
management each quarter.
7. Obsolete and Damaged Inventory
Obsolete or damaged items must be identified during periodic reviews and written off or
disposed of following approval from management.
Documentation for write-offs must be maintained, including reasons and disposal method[5].
8. Inventory Accuracy and Controls
Cycle counting (rotating counts of subsets of inventory) is required to maintain ongoing
accuracy.
Discrepancies must be reported immediately and investigated.
Barcode or tagging systems should be used for precise tracking[5].
9. Stock Rotation and Stock Review
Regular stock rotation to prevent expiry or obsolescence.
Frequent inventory checks to identify surplus or unnecessary items for timely action[5].
10. Returns and Damaged Goods
All returns must be processed with appropriate documentation, and returned goods evaluated
for restocking or disposal.

Damaged goods must be segregated and disposed of according to established procedures[5].
11. Internal Controls and Audit
Routine and surprise audits will be conducted to verify compliance and identify potential
weaknesses or risks[3].
Unexplained losses, theft, or irregularities must be reported immediately for investigation.
