Dataco Global Data Security and Cybersecurity Policy
Purpose
This policy defines the mandatory rules and procedures for ensuring the confidentiality, integrity,
and availability of Dataco Global's data, technology infrastructure, and related information assets.
The goal is to minimize risks from human error, system malfunction, and malicious cyber activity by
implementing best-practice controls and quantifiable standards[2][5].
Scope
This policy applies to all employees, contractors, third-party vendors, interns, and visitors with
temporary or permanent access to Dataco Global ºs systems, networks, or physical premises[5].
1. Access Management and Controls
All user accounts must employ Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) and strong password
protection: passwords must be at least 12 characters, include upper and lower case letters,
numbers, and symbols[1].
User access must follow the principle of least privilege. Employees are granted access only to
the information necessary for their job role. Quarterly reviews will audit access levels for 100%
of users to ensure compliance[1].
User session timeouts must be enforced after 15 minutes of inactivity, with automatic log-off
to prevent unauthorized access[1].
All failed login attempts above five within a 24-hour period will result in account lockout for a
minimum of 30 minutes and trigger an automated security alert.
2. Data Classification and Protection
All company data must be classified into: Public, Internal, Confidential, and Restricted.
Confidential or Restricted data must be encrypted both in transit (using a minimum of TLS 1.3)
and at rest (using AES-256 encryption as standard)[2].
No more than 5% of company data can be stored unencrypted at any given time; regular scans
will verify compliance every month.
Physical access to servers and data centers is restricted to authorized personnel only and
requires badge access, with logs retained for at least 12 months.
3. Network Security
Firewalls must be deployed at all external network boundaries, with port scanning and intrusion
detection systems (IDS) monitoring traffic 24/7[2].

All software and firmware must be updated and patched within 7 business days of release for
critical vulnerabilities.
Remote access to company systems must use VPN with 256-bit encryption, and connections
from untrusted networks are automatically blocked.
4. Incident Response
All employees must report suspected security incidents within 15 minutes of discovery to the
IT Security Team via a dedicated channel[1].
Incident response procedures must be tested twice a year through tabletop or live simulation
exercises.
The IT Security Team must begin containment and assessment of high-severity incidents
within 1 hour of detection, and external breaches must be disclosed to leadership within 24
hours[1].
5. Training and Awareness
All employees and contractors must complete cybersecurity awareness training within 30 days
of hire and participate in annual refresher courses; compliance rate must exceed 98%
company-wide.
A minimum of 5 simulated phishing exercises will be conducted per year; any employee failing
more than two will receive additional training.
6. Data Retention and Disposal
Company data classified as Confidential or Restricted must be retained for no longer than 7
years unless legally required.
Secure data destruction methods (e.g., shredding, wiping with DoD 5220.22-M standard) are
required for all data and devices being decommissioned, with 100% compliance documented.
7. Audit and Compliance
Quarterly internal audits will verify adherence to this policy, with results reported to executive
management. Any critical non-compliances must be remediated within 14 business days.
External audits for compliance with applicable regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA) will be
conducted at least annually.

This policy has been generated specially for hackathon purposes. It has no relation with Syngenta
or any other company.
