DataCo Global Warehouse and Storage
Policy
Introduction
This comprehensive policy outlines the guidelines, procedures, and best practices for the
warehousing and storage operations at DataCo Global. The policy aims to optimize space
utilization, improve operational efficiency, and ensure timely delivery of orders while maintaining
safety and compliance standards.
Scope and Applicability
This policy applies to all warehousing and storage facilities operated by DataCo Global, including
regional distribution centers, local warehouses, and temporary storage locations. All employees,
contractors, and third-party service providers engaged in warehouse operations must adhere to
these guidelines.
Storage Optimization Strategies
Dedicated vs. Shared Storage
DataCo Global implements a hybrid storage approach:
Dedicated Storage: Allocated for high-volume SKUs that constitute 20% of inventory but
account for 80% of transactions.
Shared Storage: Applied to remaining inventory to maximize space utilization by up to 35%
compared to fully dedicated storage[5].
Fast-Mover Positioning
Fast-moving items must be positioned closest to shipping/receiving doors to reduce travel
time by a minimum of 30%[5].
Items with high turnover rates (>5 units per day) must be stored within 50 feet of loading
docks.
Medium turnover items (2-5 units per day) must be stored within 100 feet of loading docks.
Zone-Based Storage System
The warehouse shall be divided into the following zones based on duration of stay:

--- Page 2 ---
Zone A: 1-3 days (immediate processing)
Zone B: 4-7 days (short-term storage)
Zone C: 8-14 days (medium-term storage)
Zone D: 15+ days (long-term storage)
Each zone must be clearly marked with appropriate signage and color-coding to ensure easy
identification.
Inventory Management
Receiving Procedures
1. All incoming shipments must be processed within 4 hours of arrival.
2. Quality inspection must be completed for 100% of received items.
3. Discrepancies greater than 2% of total order value must be reported to management within 24
hours.
Stock Rotation and Management
FIFO (First In, First Out) principle must be followed for 95% of inventory items.
LIFO (Last In, First Out) may be applied only for specific non-perishable items as designated
by inventory management.
Maximum inventory holding period: 90 days for standard items, 30 days for seasonal items.
Minimum safety stock levels must be maintained at 15% of average monthly demand for
critical items.
Space Utilization Standards
Storage Density Requirements
Minimum pallet position utilization rate: 85%
Maximum floor space utilization: 75% to allow for safe movement and operations
Vertical space utilization target: minimum 90% of available height
Aisle width: 10-12 feet for main aisles, 8-10 feet for secondary aisles
Warehouse Layout Optimization
Warehouse layout must be reviewed quarterly and optimized to achieve a 5% improvement in
space utilization annually[3].
The use of mezzanine floors must increase storage capacity by at least 40% in applicable
areas.

Implementation of narrow aisle racking systems where appropriate to increase storage density
by 30-40%.
Order Fulfillment and Delivery
Picking Efficiency
Standard picking rate: minimum 60 items per hour per picker
Order accuracy rate: minimum 99.5%
Pick path optimization must reduce travel distance by at least 25%
Delivery Prediction and Management
All orders must be processed within the system to predict delivery timeframes with 95%
accuracy[2].
Late delivery prediction models must be implemented to identify at-risk orders at least 24
hours before scheduled dispatch.
Contingency plans must be activated for orders with >20% probability of late delivery.
Safety and Compliance
Storage Safety Standards
Maximum stack height: 80% of sprinkler clearance or manufacturer recommendation,
whichever is lower
All racking systems must be inspected monthly with documentation
Load capacity must be clearly displayed on all storage equipment
Fire lanes must be maintained with minimum width of 8 feet and must remain unobstructed at
all times
Compliance Requirements
Hazardous materials storage areas must be segregated, with clear signage and limited access
Environmental conditions must be monitored and maintained within specified ranges:
Temperature: 65-75°F (18-24°C) for general storage
Humidity: 40-60% for general storage
Specialized storage conditions as specified for sensitive items
Technology Integration

Barcode/RFID scanning must be used for 100% of inventory transactions
Data analytics must be applied to optimize storage locations quarterly
Training and Performance Management

Policy Review and Updates
This policy shall be reviewed quarterly and updated annually or as needed to reflect changes in
business operations, technology advancements, or regulatory requirements.
