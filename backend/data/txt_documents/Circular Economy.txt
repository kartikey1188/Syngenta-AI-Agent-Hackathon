Dataco Global Circular Economy and Waste Reduction Policy
Objective
Dataco Global is committed to integrating circular economy principles and waste reduction
practices throughout our operations, supporting environmental, social, and commercial
sustainability. This policy sets forth quantifiable rules, responsibilities, and targets to ensure
effective implementation and continuous improvement.
Scope
This policy applies to all Dataco Global offices, data and information management services, and
supply chain activities worldwide[2][4].
1. Circular Economy Integration
All procurement contracts must prioritize vendors who supply reusable, recyclable, or
remanufactured products, with at least 50% of all purchased office and IT equipment
meeting these criteria by FY2026.
Dataco Global will develop and implement data lifecycle management systems that maximize
data reuse and minimize redundancy, targeting a 20% reduction in duplicate digital storage
by FY2026.
Service offerings to clients must include recommendations for digital resource optimization
and data process streamlining to minimize environmental impact.
2. Waste Reduction Targets
Achieve a minimum 60% reduction in general office waste by weight compared to FY2024
baseline levels by end of FY2026.
Divert at least 75% of electronic waste from landfill annually by engaging certified e-waste
recycling partners for all obsolete IT hardware.
Reduce single-use plastics in all global offices by 90% by piece count by FY2026,
substituting with reusable or compostable alternatives.
3. Data and Document Management
Implement mandatory digital documentation for all internal and client communications by
FY2025, reducing paper use by at least 85% compared to FY2024.
Shred and recycle 100% of sensitive paper documents in compliance with data privacy
regulations and recycling protocols[5].

4. Employee Engagement and Accountability
All employees must complete annual training in circular economy principles and waste
management best practices, with 100% participation tracked each calendar year.
Each department head is responsible for quarterly reporting on waste reduction and circularity
KPIs, including progress towards targets specified in this policy.
5. Supplier and Partner Requirements
New contracts with vendors and partners must include specific clauses mandating compliance
with Dataco Globalʼs circularity and waste reduction criteria, verified through annual audits.
Preferential consideration in procurement is to be given to suppliers who demonstrate
quantifiable circular practices, such as returning packaging material for reuse or offering take-
back programs for end-of-life equipment.
6. Monitoring, Auditing, and Continuous Improvement
An annual sustainability audit will measure corporate waste generation, recycling rates, and
progress towards stated goals, with results published in Dataco Globalʼs sustainability report.
Policy targets and processes will be reviewed every 12 months, with updates enacted to
address new technologies, regulatory requirements, or operational insights.
