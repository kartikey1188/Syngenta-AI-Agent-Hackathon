Dataco Global Supplier Relationship Management (SRM) Policy
1. Introduction
This Supplier Relationship Management (SRM) Policy outlines the expectations, standards, and
procedures governing Dataco Globalʼs engagement with suppliers. The purpose is to ensure
transparency, compliance, ethical practices, and the achievement of strategic objectives. This
policy applies to all Dataco Global employees, suppliers, and service providers engaged in
procurement, supply chain, and related activities[1][3].
2. Objectives
Establish clear and quantifiable criteria for sourcing, contracting, and managing supplier
relationships.
Ensure legal, ethical, and sustainable practices across the supply chain.
Promote risk management, continuous improvement, and value creation for all parties[1][2].
3. Policy Scope
This policy applies to:
All employees engaged in purchasing and supplier management.
All suppliers, vendors, and service providers contracted by Dataco Global, regardless of
geography or business unit[1].
4. Supplier Selection and Evaluation
Suppliers must have a minimum of three years of operating history and provide references
upon request.
Only suppliers that achieve a minimum compliance score of 85% in our Supplier Audit
Checklist will be considered for partnership.
Dataco Global requires at least three competitive bids for all purchases exceeding USD 50,000.
Re-evaluation of each active supplier must occur at least once every 12 months, with results
documented and shared with relevant stakeholders[1][2][3].
5. Compliance and Conduct
All suppliers must comply with applicable labor, tax, and social security laws, as well as
environmental and data protection regulations.
A zero-tolerance approach applies to bribery, corruption, and violation of human rights within
the supply chain.
Suppliers are required to sign Dataco Globalʼs Code of Conduct, which includes commitments
to non-discrimination, diversity, and inclusion[1].

6. Performance Management
Supplier performance will be measured quarterly using Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
such as:
On-time delivery rate (target: 98% or higher)
Quality acceptance rate (target: 95% or higher)
Customer complaint rate (maximum: 2% of deliveries per quarter)
Suppliers failing to meet KPI benchmarks for two consecutive periods will be placed on
performance review and may be suspended from future sourcing unless corrective action is
completed within 60 days[2][3].
7. Communication and Escalation
All critical supplier communications (e.g., contract updates, performance reviews, corrective
actions) must be documented using Dataco Globalʼs Supplier Management System.
Issues requiring escalation (such as legal violations or contract breaches) must be reported to
the Procurement Director within 48 hours and resolved within 30 days, where possible[4].
8. Risk Management
Suppliers are classified according to risk level (high, medium, low) based on annual risk
assessments.
High-risk suppliers must provide evidence of annual third-party audits and a business
continuity plan.
Any supplier engaged in an incident affecting supply continuity, compliance, or reputation
must undergo a root-cause analysis and submit a mitigation plan within 15 business days[1].
9. Termination and Remediation
Dataco Global reserves the right to terminate a supplier relationship for persistent non-
compliance, breaches of this policy, or failure to meet corrective action timelines.
Upon termination, the supplier will be notified in writing and given a minimum notice period of
30 days unless a severe violation necessitates immediate action[3].
10. Continuous Improvement
Biannual supplier forums will be held to foster collaboration, share best practices, and
introduce process improvements.
A minimum of 10% of suppliers will be subject to spot audits each year to ensure ongoing
compliance and improvement.
Note: This policy has been generated specially for a hackathon. It has no relation with
Syngenta or any other company.
