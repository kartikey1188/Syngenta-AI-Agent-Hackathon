Dataco Global Cost Reduction and Efficiency Policy
Purpose
This policy establishes rules and measurable targets to improve operational efficiency and reduce
costs at Dataco Global. It applies to all employees, management, contractors, and vendors acting
on behalf of the company.
Scope
This policy covers all operational areas, including procurement, data management, human
resources, IT, and facility management.
1. Procurement and Vendor Management
All purchases above $2,500 require at least three competitive quotations before approval.
Annual procurement cost reviews must identify at least 5% cost-saving opportunities per
major category.
Vendor contracts should be renegotiated every two years to seek a minimum 7% cost
reduction or added-value service.
2. Operational Efficiency
Departments must develop quarterly efficiency plans targeting a 10% reduction in non-
essential operational expenditure.
Cross-departmental process automation projects should be implemented to reduce manual
workload hours by at least 15% annually.
Utility consumption (electricity, water, internet) must be reduced by 8% year-over-year,
through monitoring and adoption of energy-saving technologies.
3. Data Governance and IT
Data storage costs must be reduced by 6% per fiscal year through archiving, deduplication,
and tiered storage solutions[3].
All digital processes identified as redundant or duplicative must be consolidated within six
months.
All employees must complete cybersecurity awareness training quarterly to reduce the risk and
cost of data breaches.
4. Human Resources and Staffing
Staff overtime must not exceed 2% of total department salary expenditure per quarter.

Annually, identify at least one process per department suitable for automation to free up 10%
of staff time for higher-value tasks.
Training expenses should be optimized: Use in-house trainers for at least 60% of all mandatory
training sessions.
5. Travel and Expenses
Domestic business travel must be approved only if remote conferencing alternatives are not
viable, aiming for a 30% year-over-year reduction in travel expenses.
Employee travel should be booked at least 21 days in advance, targeting a 15% cost advantage
versus last-minute bookings.
6. Asset and Facility Management
Conduct bi-annual asset audits to identify underutilized resources for redeployment or
disposal, with an annual depreciation cost reduction target of 5%.
Facility leasing and utility contracts must be benchmarked against market rates every two
years for cost competitiveness.
7. Monitoring, Reporting, and Compliance
All cost-reduction metrics must be tracked monthly and reported to management, with
corrective actions implemented within 30 days if targets are not met.
Department heads are accountable for compliance and will be evaluated on their ability to
achieve efficiency targets annually.
