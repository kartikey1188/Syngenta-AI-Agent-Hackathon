Dataco Global Returns and Reverse Logistics Policy
Purpose
This policy details the process, conditions, and requirements for product returns and reverse
logistics at Dataco Global. It aims to ensure transparency, operational efficiency, and customer
satisfaction with quantifiable standards.
1. Return Eligibility Criteria
Products may be returned within 30 days of the delivery date[5].
Items must be unused, in original packaging, and include all tags and accessories[1][5].
Products showing signs of use, alteration, or damage not caused during transit are not eligible
for return.
Certain items, such as customized or perishable goods, are non-returnable unless found
defective upon delivery.
2. Return Process
Customers must initiate the return process via the Dataco Global returns portal or by
contacting customer service within the 30-day window[5].
A Return Merchandise Authorization (RMA) number will be issued, which must be included in
the return shipment.
Returns without an RMA number will be refused and sent back to the sender.
3. Shipping and Handling
For defective or incorrect items, Dataco Global will provide a pre-paid return shipping label and
bear all shipping costs[5].
For all other returns, customers are responsible for return shipping fees, which will be
deducted from the refund amount when applicable[5].
All returns should be shipped to the address specified in the RMA instructions.
4. Inspection and Restocking
All returned items are subject to inspection. Processing may take up to 7 business days from
receipt.
A restocking fee of 10% of the product ºs purchase price will apply to non-defective returns,
deducted from the refund amount[5].
No restocking fees will be applied for defective goods or items returned due to Dataco Global
errors.
5. Refunds

Approved refunds will be processed to the original payment method within 5 business days
after return inspection[1][5].
In cases where original payment is unavailable, store credit will be issued[1].
Original shipping fees are non-refundable except for defective or mis-shipped items.
6. Exchanges
Exchanges are allowed for defective or incorrect products if requested within 30 days of
delivery.
If the requested replacement is unavailable, a full refund or store credit will be issued instead.
7. Reverse Logistics
All returned goods will be assessed for possible restocking, refurbishment, or recycling,
depending on condition.
Returns data will be reviewed quarterly to identify product quality or logistics issues, aiming to
reduce return rates by at least 5% per quarter.
8. Policy Enforcement
Dataco Global reserves the right to deny returns suspected of abuse or fraud or those outside
stated guidelines.
Continuous failure to comply with return instructions may result in suspension of return
privileges.
