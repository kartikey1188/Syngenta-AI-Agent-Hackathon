Dataco Global Technology Adoption Policy
Purpose
This policy establishes clear standards for the adoption and management of emerging technologies
(including Internet of Things (IoT), Blockchain, and related innovations) within Dataco Global. It
ensures all technology use aligns with company objectives, emphasizes security, safeguards data,
and supports operational excellence through measurable controls and responsibilities.
Scope
This policy applies to all employees, contractors, partners, and third-party service providers
involved in the selection, deployment, management, and operation of IoT, Blockchain, and similar
technologies within Dataco Globalʼs business processes.
1. Technology Evaluation and Approval
All new technology projects must undergo a standardized evaluation, including risk
assessment and Return on Investment (ROI) analysis, before approval.
A minimum of two formal pilot tests, each covering at least 10% of the relevant operational
environment, are required prior to full-scale deployment.
The Technology Steering Committee (TSC) must approve any expenditure over $100,000 or
any project impacting more than 25% of company data infrastructure.
2. Data Governance and Protection
Data collected or generated by IoT devices and Blockchain applications must be classified
according to Dataco Globalʼs data governance standards (confidential, internal, public).
Only authorized personnel (not exceeding 20% of departmental staff per project) may access
sensitive or confidential data[4].
Encryption must be applied to all data transmissions involving IoT devices and Blockchain
transactions.
All data must be retained only as long as necessary for business or regulatory requirements,
with quarterly reviews to ensure compliance[5].
At least one Data Steward must be assigned to each project to oversee data ownership, access
controls, and compliance[4].
3. Security and Compliance
All devices and systems must undergo penetration testing at least twice annually.
Any technology solution must comply with applicable industry standards (e.g., ISO 27001) and
regulatory frameworks (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).

Incident response protocols must be in place, with a maximum incident response time of 4
hours for critical breaches.
Multi-factor authentication is mandatory for administrative access to IoT, Blockchain, and
associated management platforms.
4. Performance and Reliability
IoT systems must achieve at least 99.5% uptime; Blockchain nodes must have a minimum of
two redundant nodes per key business network.
All deployed technologies must be reviewed bi-annually for performance, with a target of less
than 1% device or node failure rate.
5. Vendor and Third-Party Management
All vendors providing IoT or Blockchain services must sign a data protection agreement and
undergo an annual security audit.
No more than 30% of critical infrastructure may depend on a single third-party provider to
mitigate operational risks.
6. Training and Awareness
All users must complete an approved training module on responsible technology use and
security before gaining access to relevant platforms. A refresher course is required every 12
months.
At least 95% of identified stakeholders must complete their training within 60 days of
technology rollout.
7. Monitoring and Reporting
Continuous monitoring solutions must be deployed for all IoT and Blockchain systems to detect
anomalies or unauthorized access, with alerting thresholds set according to impact risk.
Quarterly reports on usage, incidents, and compliance must be submitted to senior
management.
Note: This policy has been generated specially for the hackathon. It has no relation with
Syngenta or any other company.
