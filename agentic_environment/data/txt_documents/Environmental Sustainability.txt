Dataco Global Environmental Sustainability Policy: Green Supply
Chain
Purpose
Dataco Global is committed to integrating environmental sustainability into every aspect of its data
and information management services, with a particular focus on the global upstream oil & gas
sector. This policy outlines clear, quantifiable rules and standards for reducing our environmental
impact across supply chains and operations, driving accountability, innovation, and measurable
progress[2][4].
1. Energy Efficiency and Carbon Emissions
All Dataco Global offices and facilities must reduce energy consumption by at least 15% from
2024 levels by the end of 2027.
100% of new office hardware, including servers and computing infrastructure, must meet or
exceed ENERGY STAR® certification.
Reduce direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions (Scope 1 and 2) by 20% by 2030 relative
to the 2024 baseline, measured in tonnes CO₂e.
2. Sustainable Procurement
A minimum of 60% of all third-party suppliers by spend must be evaluated for environmental
sustainability practices by the end of 2026.
All suppliers must commit to eliminating single-use plastics from shipments to Dataco Global
by 2027.
Require all new suppliers to submit annual environmental performance data, with continued
contracts contingent on meeting Dataco Globalʼs sustainability standards.
3. Waste Management
Achieve a 40% reduction in non-recyclable office waste generation across all global facilities
by 2027.
Implement mandatory e-waste recycling programs at every location, with at least 95% of
decommissioned electronic equipment responsibly recycled or repurposed annually.
Enhance digital document management to achieve a 30% annual reduction in paper use,
compared with 2024 usage.
4. Transportation and Logistics
By 2026, 50% of all business travel and logistics must use lower-emission alternatives (e.g.,
electric vehicles, public transit, or carbon-offset programs).

All logistics partners must provide verified documentation of carbon footprint annually, with
preference given to partners demonstrating year-over-year emission reductions.
5. Water Conservation
All offices to install water-saving fixtures, targeting a minimum 20% reduction in water
consumption (compared to 2024) by 2027.
Require facility managers to submit quarterly water usage reports and corrective action plans if
targets are missed.
6. Employee Engagement and Training
All employees must complete mandatory environmental sustainability training by the end of
2025, refreshed annually.
Establish a “Green Champions” program with at least one representative per department to
oversee sustainability initiatives and report monthly progress.
7. Performance Measurement and Reporting
Dataco Global will publish an annual Environmental Impact Report, audited by an external
party, disclosing progress toward each quantifiable goal stated in this policy.
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) will be reviewed quarterly; failure by any business unit to
meet targets will trigger a corrective action review by senior management.
8. Continuous Improvement
This policy will be reviewed annually, with updated targets set every three years.
All employees are encouraged to submit innovations or suggestions, with implemented ideas
eligible for annual recognition and rewards.
Note: This policy has been generated specially for the hackathon and has no relation with
Syngenta or any other company.
